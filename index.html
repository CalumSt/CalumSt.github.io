            <h3>Solving each problem as it arises</h3>
            <p>It can be subject matter of a religious nature. A scene in a foreign country. What ever the subject,
                the professional artist makes exhaustive studies of it. When they feel that they have interpreted
                the subject to the extent of their capabilities, they may have a one-person exhibition whose theme
                is the solution of the problem. It is surprising how few people who view the paintings realise this.
