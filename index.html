        <h3>Solving each problem as it arises</h3>
        <p>It can be subject matter of a religious nature. A scene in a foreign country. What ever the subject, the
            professional artist makes exhaustive studies of it. When they feel that they have interpreted the subject to
            the extent of their capabilities, they may have a one-person exhibition whose theme is the solution of the
            problem. It is surprising how few people who view the paintings realise this.</p>
