                    <h2>It can be subject matter of a religious nature. A scene in a foreign country. What ever the subject, the
                        professional artist makes exhaustive studies of it. When they feel that they have interpreted the
                        subject to
                        the extent of their capabilities, they may have a one-person exhibition whose theme is the solution of
                        the
                        problem. It is surprising how few people who view the paintings realise this.</h2>
